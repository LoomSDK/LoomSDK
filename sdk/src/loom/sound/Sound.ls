     * A sound, which may potentially play.
     *
     * Loom supports positional audio. Sounds may have their volume, position,
     * pitch, and looping status modified to suit the needs of your
     * application.
     *
     * Source files can be in MP3 or OGG format. Note that MP3 supports 
     * requires that you have a valid license to perform MP3 playback.
     *
     * Note that sounds are stored uncompressed in memory. One minute of CD 
     * quality stereo audio takes about 10MB of storage. Be aware when 
     * running on mobile devices!
     *
     * Sound asset data is only loaded once, so you can safely call Sound.load()
     * as much as you like without consuming lots of memory.
     *
     * Make sure to call deleteNative() on Sounds when you are done with them.
     * This frees up critical audio resources. Behind the scenes, Loom attempts
     * to reuse audio playback resources. It does this by stealing inactive 
     * Sound's resources after about 64 are active. New Sound instances will 
     * steal from old Sounds which are not playing. This will keep things running
     * smoothly, but can lead to absent/silent sounds.
     *
     * See the PositionalAudioExample for a great example of using the Sound and
     * Listener classes.
