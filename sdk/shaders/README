Currently, Loom precompiles shaders using bgfx's shaderc, and then links them
into the Loom executable so you don't have to deal with bundling a bunch of
mandatory files with your app.

The buildShaders.sh/buildShaders.bat scripts will rebuild the shaders, but you 
can just run:

```
rake utility:compileShaders
```

which will recompile shaderc, and recompile the shaders. If you have modified 
the shaders you will the need to compile Loom once more to have them take effect.

LOOM-1856 tracks improving this process to not require two compiles. Modifying
shaders currently is rare.

We include the PosTex and PosColorTex shaders because on some older hardware 
(iPad 1) the PosColorTex shader is very slow. Loom content runs substantially
faster with the addition of the second shader.

The .cpp binary versions of the shaders are checked in so that the engine will
compile more conveniently out of box.
