## Overview

This example displays activity detected by the device's motion sensor. This data represents the device's location or movement along a 3-dimensional axis. When the device moves, the sensor detects this movement and returns acceleration data.

Using the Accelerometer example is simple, run the application on a device with an Accelerometer, and then tilt the device to move the Poly Sprite around.
