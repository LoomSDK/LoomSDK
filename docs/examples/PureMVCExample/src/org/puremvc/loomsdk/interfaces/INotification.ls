     * The interface definition for a PureMVC Notification.
     *
     * <P>
     * PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such 
     * as the one provided with Flash, and ActionScript 3 does 
     * not have an inherent event model.</P>
     * 
     * <P>
     * The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists 
     * to support event-driven communication between the 
     * application and the actors of the MVC triad.</P>
     * 
     * <P>
     * Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
     * in Flex/Flash/AIR. Generally, <code>IMediator</code> implementors
     * place event listeners on their view components, which they
     * then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of <code>Notification</code>s to 
     * trigger <code>ICommand</code>s or to communicate with other <code>IMediators</code>. <code>IProxy</code> and <code>ICommand</code>
     * instances communicate with each other and <code>IMediator</code>s 
     * by broadcasting <code>INotification</code>s.</P>
     * 
     * <P>
     * A key difference between Flash <code>Event</code>s and PureMVC 
     * <code>Notification</code>s is that <code>Event</code>s follow the 
     * 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy 
     * until some parent component handles the <code>Event</code>, while
     * PureMVC <code>Notification</code>s follow a 'Publish/Subscribe'
     * pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a 
     * parent/child relationship in order to communicate with one another
     * using <code>Notification</code>s.
